    	<p>
    		<b>HTML</b> is the language of the web (Syntax + Rules). The browser turns HTML tag into elements in tree (thanks to <b>DOM</b>-Document Object Model). HTML is structure of web.

        <b>CSS</b> is also the language of the web (Syntax + Rules). Syntax under CSS is made up of color, size, font, background borders, position etc. CSS is the code written to control the style of HTML elements. CSS number 1 Rule is to avoid repetition.<br>
        Javascript is simply the interactive module.<br>

      <h3 id="Part-1.1">How Do I Include CSS Styling In My WebPage</h3> <!-- This subheading highlights on the introduction of CSS styling -->
      <p>
         There are <b>three (3)</b> ways you can do this.<br>
         <h4>Method 1:</h4> Write CSS in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML<br>
            If you want to quickly style an HTML document, you can do the following:<br>
            <ul>
               <li>
                1. At the top of your HTML document, add a &lt;head&gt; element.<br>
                2. Inside the &lt;head&gt; element, add a &lt;style&gt; element.<br>
                3. Write your CSS in the &lt;style&gt; element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
      <p>
      <h4>Method 2:</h4> Link your HTML to a separate CSS file.<br>
          This adds another step, but lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file.<br>
              2. In a separate file, put all of your CSS code.<br>
              3. Add a &lt;head&gt; element to the top of your HTML.<br>
              4. Add a &lt;link&gt; tag inside the &lt;head&gt; element, since &lt;link&gt; is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing &lt;/link&gt;<br>
              5. Add the following attributes to your &lt;link&gt;:<br>
                a) rel="stylesheet"<br>
                b) href="main.css"<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
     <p>
    	<h4>Method 3:</h4> Write your style inline with your HTML<br>
    	This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lot of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it.<br> With this method, you modify the style attributes of every individual HTML element.<br>
    <h3 id="Part-1-2">Box Sizing and Position Summary</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Box Sizing:</h4> There are <b>four (4)</b> main points that addresses box sizing.<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1. HTML elements are boxes and each box has four (4) components.<br>
              2. It is often hard to get the size of a box.<br>
              3. There are two (2) techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues:<br>
                a) Set sizes in terms of percentage (%) rather than pixels (px).<br>
                b) Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.<br>
              4. Different browsers work slightly differently.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Box Positioning:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1. Divs are <b>block</b> elements (as opposed to<b>inline</b>), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.<br>
              2. Adding the rule <em>display:flex;</em> to the appropriate CSS will override this behaviour and let divs appear next to each other.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
    <h2 id="Part-2">CODE, TEST, REFINE</h2> <!-- Keypoints for coding -->
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Look for natural boxes.<br>
            2. Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.<br>
            3. Write your HTML.<br>
            4. Apply styles.<br>
            5. Fix things.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </div>      
</body>
